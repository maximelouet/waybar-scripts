# waybar-scripts

My personal [waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) scripts (mostly shell scripts, not very clean).

There's some remains of my i3blocks scriptsâ€¦ Use at your own risk :)

These scripts are included in [my personal dotfiles](https://github.com/maximelouet/dotfiles) and are cloned as a submodule inside it.
